# Approximating The Permanent
* adj.txt : this file contains adjacency list of input graph and we will compute number of perfect matchings present in that graph.
* JS_implementation.cpp : main program which approximate the count of perfect matchings of input graph
* maximal_Bipartite_matching.cpp : this program checks for existence of perfect matching in the input graph
* ryserAlgo.cpp : this program computes the exact value of Permanent of the input matrix
* runner.cpp : it contains script which start the execution of whole project
