# Approximating The Permanent
adj.txt : contains adjacency list of input graph of which number of perfect matchings are to be counted
JS_implementation.cpp : main program which approximate the count of perfect matchings of input graph
maximal_Bipartite_matching.cpp : this program checks for existence of perfect matching in the input graph
ryserAlgo.cpp : this program computes the exact value of Permanent of the input matrix
runner.cpp : it contains script which start the execution of whole project
